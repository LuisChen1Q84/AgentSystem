# Research Hub Methods

- Every research report starts with an explicit research question, target audience, and decision to support.
- Separate source collection from writing. Do not write claims before building a source plan and evidence ledger.
- For every major claim, record at least one primary source or one clearly labeled assumption.
- Keep assumptions in a register. Mark which ones drive TAM/SAM/SOM, margin pools, pricing, or GTM conclusions.
- Add a peer review layer after drafting. Flag unsupported claims, hidden optimism, and logical jumps.
- Reports should end with a decision-oriented synthesis, not just a descriptive summary.
- When possible, prepare a PPT bridge so a report can become a CEO text deck without rewriting the logic.
- For market and strategy work, prefer frameworks as scaffolding, but keep outputs evidence-led rather than template-led.
