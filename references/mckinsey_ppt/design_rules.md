# Premium Deck Design Rules

- Start every slide with an assertion title that can stand alone as the takeaway.
- Use one dominant visual hierarchy: title, proof, action.
- Give numbers visual priority over adjectives; executives trust quantified movement.
- Reserve accent color for the one point that should change the decision.
- Keep every slide readable within ten seconds.
- Avoid equal-weight bullet lists; use a lead point and subordinate evidence.
- Treat whitespace as structure, not as empty background.
- If a chart does not change a decision, remove it.
- Use appendix slides only for challenge-ready evidence and definitions.
