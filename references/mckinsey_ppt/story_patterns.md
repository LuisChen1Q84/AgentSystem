# Premium Deck Story Patterns

- Situation -> Complication -> Insight -> Answer -> Decision is the default boardroom arc.
- Every section should end with a decision implication, not just a recap.
- Diagnose only the problems that explain the result gap.
- Compare options on value, effort, risk, and speed on one slide whenever possible.
- Turn strategy into a three-wave roadmap so the audience sees sequence and ownership.
- Pair each risk with a mitigation and a governance rhythm.
- Close with explicit approval asks, resource impact, and immediate next steps.
