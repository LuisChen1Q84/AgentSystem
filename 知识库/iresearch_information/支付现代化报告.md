                                  signs of card replacement by any other payment method in-store. Contactless has
                                  been a very strong driver of card growth in the last years, both through mobile and
                                  card transactions. Online, there is more space for alternative payment methods to
                                  grow, such as wallets and BNPL.”

                                      success. Financial Institutions need to take a proactive approach to payments modernisation

                                     Japanese market. The higher proportion of cash payments and the
                                     dominance of credit cards in contactless transactions require tailored
                                     approaches. Additionally, the proliferation of providers necessitates careful

                                     expansion of e-commerce are posing new challenges for Retailers, requiring
